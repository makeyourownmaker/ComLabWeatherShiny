Interactive exploration of the Cambridge University
Computer Laboratory [weather station](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/weather/) measurements.


## Details
The [Digital Technology Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/) in the Cambridge University 
[Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/) maintain a [weather station](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/weather/).

This R [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app provides an interactive exploration of some of this data.

### Variables
The weather measurements include the following variables.
  
| Variables         | Units                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Temperature       | Celsius (°C) * 10          |
| Dew Point         | Celsius (°C) * 10          |
| Humidity          | Percent                    |
| Pressure          | mBar                       |
| Wind Speed Mean   | Knots * 10                 |
| Wind Bearing Mean | Degrees                    |
| Timestamp         | Data Hours:Minutes:Seconds |

Dew point is the temperature at which air, at a level of constant pressure, can no longer hold all the 
water it contains.  Dew point is defined [here](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/weather/dewpoint.html) 
and in more detail [here](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/meteorology/temp-dewpoint/).

There are known issues with the sunlight and rain sensors.  These measurements are not included for now.


### Cleaning

The data included in the app start on 2008-08-01 when the weather station was moved to it's current 
[location](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/weather/map.html).  Unrealistically high wind speed (> 60), 
low humidity (< 25) and low temperature (< -20) values were removed.  The Digital Technology 
Group list [inaccuracies](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/weather/inaccuracies.html) in the weather 
data.  All measurements for the entire day or days was removed for each of the listed inaccuracies.
[Cook's distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%27s_distance) 
was used to remove the remaining influential observations but some problems may remain in the data, such as 
long series of repeated values.  The remaining measurements have no missing values.  

There are two cleaning scripts included in the scripts directory: 
  1) [1-load.R](scripts/1-load.R) which loads the data and adds some date and time related fields.
  2) [2-clean.R](scripts/2-clean.R) which removes unrealistic and inaccurate measurements.

I have no affiliation with Cambridge University, the Computer Laboratory or the Digital Technology Group.


## Installation/Usage
Usage is probably best done within [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

```
# Install required libraries
install.packages("shiny")
install.packages("data.table")

library(shiny)

# Only run in interactive R sessions
if (interactive()) {
  runGitHub("makeyourownmaker/ComLabWeatherShiny")
}
```


## Roadmap

* Improve documentation
  * Add screenshots to README
* Add tests
* Make app available on [shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io/)
